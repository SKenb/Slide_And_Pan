# Slide and Pan

## Overview 

    To give a timelapse that special touch, movement is essential. With this simple self-made and inexpensive slider, one can easily achieve that.

"Slide and Pan" stands for a small, compact, and "all in one" DIY slider.

### All in one

_Just place the Slider and start shooting._

The solution provides one small, solid metal box. (55 x 50 x 145 mm - TODO kg). So all required electronics and mechanics in it and no further motors, batteries, control devices are needed.

### Cheap

_Adjust the expenses to your budget._

One key argument for building an own Slider is the relatively small expenses compared to conventional Sliders. One might also think of requesting prepared or finished parts within a fair price ...

### DIY

_You are the boss_

The plans are no secret and easily be replicated by yourself. Just have a look at the public construction plans or come up with your own modified version.
